# PROJECT MOTIVATION
- The original motivation of building this web application was the learn the [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) framework.
- As a developer coming from the background of reactJS, I wanted to explore the server-side framework built on top of ReactJS.
- I learned a lot of new concepts, and gained more understanding in aspects like next-routing, hot-reload-features, server-side-rendering, static generation, accessible nextJS properties including Image, Link, etc.   
- I am very passionate about the JavaScript ecosystem. Most of my contributions and reasearch are mainly around the JavaScript Programming Language.
